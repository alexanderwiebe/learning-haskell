# Learning Functional

When I started learning Cardano I felt there was a lot of 'stuff' that I didn't understand. It uses Plutus which is eagerly executing Haskell. I set out to learn this 'once and for all' and found it quite a daunting task. From learning about new tool chains, people, and entirely new ways of thinking. I knew I had to learn as much as possible.

With that in mind I wanted to make something similar to what I did for Kubernetes where I collected links to useful resources to plot out a path on how to keep track and develop a syllabus for myself.
